Hola Amigos! ( Web developer/ Blockchain & ML Enthusiast/ Currently dwelling into Cloud Computing )
![Ola](https://github.com/AemieJ/AemieJ/raw/master/aj.gif)

I am Aemie Jariwala, an undergrad at NIT, Surat. I love coding a bit too much and keep myself occupied with work. 
I am a fan of comedy and technical TV series as well ( so I am a bit fun as well! )
Last but not the least, I am an Outreachy'20 intern @Apache for improving camel website. I have written blogs related to my journey 
with Apache & Outreachy. Will be posting all the important links below. 

A little more about me -
